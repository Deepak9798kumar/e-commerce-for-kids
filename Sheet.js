                    <h2>Weâ€™ve given considerable thought to designing each of these activities. They are easy for you to use (just download & print!), need the most basic stationery supplies (scissors, gum, paper cutter, pencil, crayons, etc), and offer hours of thinking and entertainment for your little one.</h2><br />
